// Documentation: You don't have to copy these lines over
// This script assumes you're travelling in a straight line and
// will take a bit of travelling in one to get an accurate reading
// Pitch is your "vertical" angle from the Z axis with 0 being flat
// along the plane of the belt, and -90 and 90 being perpendicular
// Heading is your "horizontal" angle from the Z axis with 0 being
// along it pointing into the belt, 90 being along the X axis pointing
// "left" along the belt, and it wrapping back around to 360 pointing
// back into the belt
